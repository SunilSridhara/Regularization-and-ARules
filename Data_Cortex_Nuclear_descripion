The data set consists of the expression levels of 77 proteins/protein modifications that  produced   detectable   signals in the nuclear fraction of  cortex. There are 38 control  mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome), for a total of 72 mice. In the  experiments, 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse. Therefore, for control mice, there are 38x15, or 570 measurements, and for trisomic mice, there are 34x15, or 510 measurements. The dataset contains a total of 1080 measurements per protein
